# Molly Cunnane

I was born in Australia but technically I am only one eighth Australian. I can only fluently speak English however, I’m currently learning Spanish. I graduated from Sunshine Beach State High School in December of 2017. 
I love to draw and paint as well as reading and writing.


## Interest in IT:

IT interests me because it has a whole world of its own. It has the opportunity to be explored and for discoveries to be made. These discoveries then can lead to creating something that is impactful in the world today. Developments in technology/information technology allows for improvement on issues that are medical and environmental, as well as advancing in the research for both those areas. The whole idea of being able to understand and manipulate the path that is being carved into the future with IT is what appeals to me. I wrote a short story for creative writing in my ninth year at school that featured a girl who had cancer and was saved by her father who figured out a way to transfer her mind into an artificial body and programmed it so that she would terminate if/when the government found out. Although I had no real idea of the science behind it I found the subject fascinating and I could say that was around the time I became more interested and aware of IT and what it involves. However, my experience in this field is limited to the basic everyday interactions I have with my phone and computer. This is due to the question i have of where to begin. I am currently studying a degree in technology at the royal Melbourne institute of technology. I choose to study here because I found it to be the best option with the general direction I am planning which is a more hands on into IT rather than academic studies on it. When I graduate I expect to have a solid foundation of what the area of Technology and IT involves and have a clearer direction in which I would like to go with it. I would like to have some fundamental skills that can aid me in both a career and everyday life.  I am excited to learn all I can out of this degree as it is going to be very valuable in the future.

## Ideal job:

The job I believe to be of interest to me at this point in time is the position of an Intelligence Analyst at the ASIO. Although this ideal will undoubtable change over the course of my study due to the progression of the IT world and my experience within it. The role of an Intelligence Analyst is to recognise patterns and examine anomalies. Investigation and research into certain issues is also required. This appeals to me as I love to problem solve and be in a high energy, fast tempo environment. Although I know the work would be stressful due to pressure I believe I wouldn’t mind this as the work would be fulfilling. From the job description the skills required for the role are to be able to research and analyse information then orally present it. Then it requires mostly behavioural traits/disciplines such as integrity, communication, works well in a team and individually, has excellent judgement, and good corporation. The qualifications required a 3-year undergraduate bachelor's degree before July 2019 which is unattainable for me since I graduate in 2021. The experience would be working in a high stress environment where you are expected to perform well under pressure. Currently I have the skills to effectively communicate yet not to the level that is expected in this position however that is something I can easily develop over time.  I am a trust worthy and loyal person and that would be a behaviour trait that the ASIO would be looking for. The direction I need to head in to be able to achieve/develop these necessary skills would be to finish my bachelor’s degree do some extracurricular activates to enhance my skill set both mentally and physically. Maybe get a full-time job once I graduate that would be beneficial to my resume when applying for this position. 

## Project ideas: 

My idea for an interesting project idea would be creating an app that allows the user to sell their ideas. This app can be used by big companies that are looking for original and creative ideas to help their product succeeded or evolve. It will also be a place for the everyday person to put their ideas into action and make some money off of.
This app would be useful as it would be a direct link between the big businesses and their consumers. The business would benefit as the ideas would be coming from the user and therefore the product would be geared more to their needs and the consumer numbers would most likely increase. It would also benefit anyone who has ideas to improve upon or create something but doesn’t have the time or the resources to put them into action then not only can they see it happen, but they would get paid for it.  
So, the app would be a place where people can create a public profile and advertise their ideas these ideas can range anywhere from large scale to minuscule improvements on things and they can be as creative as they want. There would be features for the person who wants to buy the ideas so that they can narrow down their search to something particular they want. Or, if they want to find any ideas on certain products/applications/business then there would be a search engine or something similar to aid them. And, if anyone wants to just find something completely new then they can browse the latest inspirational ideas others have had.  There would also be some sort of security inline to make sure no one steals ideas without any recognition of the owner and the users can feel at ease when posting their content. 
The equipment that would be required for this project would be the IOS development program and an integrated development environment like eclipse or NetBeans. The skills, software and hardware needed to create this project would be the ability to use java, objective-c or another programming language that allows you to create smartphone applications. These days there are heaps of resources to help you learn how to code there are online tutorials, apps, and textbooks but instead you can use tools to assist you without any knowledge in programming or you can hire someone to write it for you. In terms of hardware a decent computer should be enough. Then you would have to get the app approved by apple to see if it is user friendly. Then it would be down to making the app public and advertising it (Love, 2018). If the project ran smoothly the optimal result from would be highly functioning smartphone application that benefits anyone that gets frustrated by ideas, they can’t implement and help business to grow and flourish. A further result that would be ideal is that the ideas people come up with help solve some big issues within industries that have to do with sustainability and ethics. 

## Personal profile:

1. My test results for the 16-personality test is  “The Campaigner” (ENFP-T) 

2. My test result for the education planner learning styles quiz is a Tactile with
•	Auditory: 15%
•	Visual: 40%

3. university of Kent groupwork skills assessment
 
 Evaluator 5
 Ideas Person 7
 Leader 5
 Compromiser 8
 Summariser 5
 Recorder 5
 Encourager 8
The results for these tests tell me that I am capable of more than I give myself credit sometimes and that I need to understand and work with weakness in order to progress. According to these results I have very strong team member skills as I am empathetic and good at compromising as well as coming up with ideas. I think it also shows that my behaviour is less leader and more of a supporter. Therefore, when forming a team, I would nominate someone more in the role of the leader to make the decisions and direct the group and would work as ideas/problems solver to help the group along.
